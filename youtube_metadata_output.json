        "description": "Nuclear Energy Explained: How does it work?\n\nNuclear Energy is a controversial subject. The pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies fight furiously, and it's difficult to decide who is right. So we're trying to clear up the issue - in this video we discuss how we got to where we are today, as the basis for discussion. Next week we'll be looking at the arguments for and against nuclear power in detail.\n\nTo get a free audiobook and support our channel, go to audible.com/nutshell  - thanks! : )\n\nPRO VIDEO:

Yes many disasters related to nuclear energy have taken place BUT there were 0 deaths in the Fukushima catastrophe and studies show that working in an office space can be more dangerous than working at a nuclear power plant. 1000x more deaths are caused by planes than nuclear energy in the US alone.\n\n\n(Im rlly sorry if i got anything wrong btw im in the ninth grade and very dumb.

            "text": "History of Nuclear\n Energy:\n\nThe beginnings of nuclear energy can be traced back to the discovery of radioactivity in the late 19th century. In the 1930s, scientists began to explore the possibility of using nuclear reactions to produce energy. The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 as part of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. In the following decades, nuclear energy was developed for peaceful purposes, including electricity generation.\n\nHow Nuclear Energy Works:\nNuclear energy is produced through the process of nuclear fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This energy is used to heat water, producing steam that drives turbines to generate electricity. Nuclear reactors are designed to control the rate of fission and prevent uncontrolled reactions, which could lead to a nuclear meltdown.\n\nWhere Nuclear Energy is Now:\nNuclear energy is currently used to generate about 10% of the world's electricity, with the majority of nuclear power plants located in the United States, France, China, and Russia. However, public opinion and government policies around nuclear energy have been mixed due to concerns about safety, waste disposal, and the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation.\n\nEvolution of Nuclear Energy:\nOver the years, there have been various advancements in nuclear energy technology, including the development of smaller, modular reactors and the use of nuclear fusion, which involves combining atomic nuclei to release energy. There have also been efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of nuclear reactors, as well as to address concerns around nuclear waste and proliferation. Additionally, there has been a growing interest in renewable energy sources, which has prompted some countries to phase out or reduce their reliance on nuclear energy.\n\nIn conclusion, nuclear energy has a complex history, and its use and development have been shaped by a variety of factors. While nuclear energy has the potential to provide a significant source of low-carbon electricity, it also raises a number of environmental, safety, and security concerns. The future of nuclear energy will likely depend on continued advancements in technology and policy, as well as the evolving energy needs of society.\nKey terms i've learned:\n\n- Core: The central part of a nuclear reactor where nuclear reactions take place.\n- Critical mass: The amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.\n- Fast breeder reactor: A type of nuclear reactor that produces more fissile material than it consumes, using fast neutrons.\n- Fusion: A type of nuclear reaction in which atomic nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing energy in the process.\n- Meltdown: A catastrophic failure of a nuclear reactor that can lead to the release of radioactive material.\n- Nuclear: Relating to the nucleus of an atom.\n- Nuclear fission: The splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process.\n- Nuclear power: The use of nuclear reactions to generate electricity.\n- Nuclear reactor: A device that initiates and controls a nuclear chain reaction, typically used for the generation of electricity.\n- Nuclear waste: Radioactive material left over from nuclear reactions, which is typically stored in specialized facilities.\n- Plutonium: A radioactive element used as a fuel in nuclear reactors and in the production of nuclear weapons.\n- Calandria: A component of some nuclear reactors that houses the fuel rods.\n- Actinide: A group of radioactive elements that includes uranium and plutonium.\n- Activation product: A radioactive material produced when a non-radioactive material is exposed to radiation.\n- PWR: Pressurized water reactor, a common type of nuclear reactor used for electricity generation.\n- Radiation: Energy that is emitted in the form of waves or particles from a source, such as a radioactive material.\n- Radioactive waste: Material that contains radioactive elements and poses a potential hazard to human health and the environment.\n- Reactor: Short for nuclear reactor.\n- Thermonuclear: Relating to nuclear reactions that occur at extremely high temperatures.\n- ALARA: As Low As Reasonably Achievable, a principle used in the management of radiation exposure to minimize risks to human health.\n- Alpha particle: A type of particle emitted by certain radioactive materials.\n- Atom: The basic unit of matter, consisting of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons.\n- Background radiation: The natural radiation that is present in the environment.\n- Base load: The minimum level of electricity demand that must be met continuously.\n- Becquerel: A unit of measurement for the activity of radioactive materials.\n- Beta particle: A type of particle emitted by certain radioactive materials.\n- Boiling water reactor: A type of nuclear reactor that uses steam generated from boiling water to drive turbines.\n- Breed: The production of additional fissile material, typically through the use of a breeder reactor.\n\n\n\nNuclear energy is a powerful and efficient source of electricity, but it also comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are some pros and cons of nuclear energy:\n\nPros:\n1. High power output: Nuclear power plants generate a large amount of electricity from a small amount of fuel, making it a highly efficient source of energy.\n2. Low carbon emissions: Unlike fossil fuel-burning power plants, nuclear power plants do not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n3. Reliability: Nuclear power plants can operate continuously for long periods of time without interruption, making it a reliable source of electricity.\n4. Energy security: Nuclear power does not rely on imported fuels, reducing a country's dependence on foreign resources.\n5. Medical and scientific applications: Nuclear technology has important applications in medicine, such as in cancer treatment, and in scientific research.\n\nCons:\n1. Safety concerns: Nuclear power plants have the potential for accidents, which can result in serious environmental and health consequences.\n2. Nuclear waste: Nuclear power produces radioactive waste that remains dangerous for thousands of years, and there is currently no proven method for safe long-term storage.\n3. High cost: Nuclear power plants are expensive to build and maintain, and the costs of decommissioning plants and disposing of nuclear waste must also be factored in.\n4. Proliferation risk: The same technology used to produce nuclear power can also be used to produce nuclear weapons, which raises concerns about the spread of nuclear weapons.\n5. Public perception: Nuclear power is often associated with negative public perceptions due to past accidents and concerns about safety and waste disposal.",

Unlike fossil fuels, uranium has never been part of Earth's energy cycle, without humans causing a nuclear reaction, this energy would remain trapped forever. \n\nIt is 1950s technology, using steam power, an even older technology of the 19th century when global warming was just being started, to run turboines. It has thus added the sum total of energy released to the problem of a warming world, and cqannot be considered any part of a solution. Yet nbuclear cultists continue to claim it is thechnology for the future, that anyone who opposes it is a Luddite and doesn't understand, that nuclrear supporters are advanced and hampered by the ignorant. Actually the reverse is true, modern technology is harnessing power from wind, water, tides and sun, this technology did not exist back in the 1950s when nuclear was started principally to supply plutonium for weapons. The mind set of its fans is thus fixed in the 1950s, and no amount of raqtional argument or logic seems capable of persuading them it is not what it seems. That's why I call it a cult; based on false beliefs, mired with secrecy and misinformation, and growing every more costly so much so that nuclear builders demand a high energy cost paid by consumers to profit them into the future. So electricy bills would need to rise and rise to pay for the costs whiuch run into many billions and are revised upwards during the course of the ten years or so build time. Renrewables at the sdame time are halving in cost annually and are now the cheapest and fastest means of supplying actual clean cheap energy, something nuclear constantly claims when what it produces is worse than dirty and costs the Earth. \n\nThe only possible future is 100% actual renewables, and not those claimed as renewable which are simply not, such as geothermal, which again adds all the energy created to the already warming planet, energy which would otherwise remain deep in the planel's crust. Nuclear power pumps billions of gallons of hot water into the oceans, considered waste by the blinkered nuclear cultists and of no consequence, illustrating their total ignorance of not just the ecosystem but of energy reality. \n\nIt would be good to see Wikipedia reflect this reality and not be so encouraging and complacent about nuclear. And I haven't once mentioned nuclear disasters, of which there are hundreds but only t5he biggest are mentioned, and the continuing problem of sp-ent fuel, which has always going to be a problem for future generations to cope with, I think future generations are going to have trouble enough simply surviving the shattered world we will be leaving them. Another problem o9f nuclear never considered or mentioned is the fact of sea levelk rise and the inconvenient fact that nuclear power stations are almost always situated on coasts at sea level for access to unlimited cooling water, the energy so transferred being pumped straight into the sea. Perhaps nuclear fans can enlighten everyone on what will happen to a flooded nuclear pile? \n\nAnd with Thwaites Glacier due to break off into the sea in a matter of 2-5 years, I wonder if any politicians are considering how to decommision all the existing nuclear plants in the world before that happens. Building any more is folly of a kind not even hominids have indulged in before. \n\nWhat's needed is clear critical thinking on this subject, not the usual simplistic, complacent, patronising 'experts' who think everyone failing to support their pet megafix needs to be educated on the process which will somehow banish all doubts.  \n\n~~~~",

Biden took over, eventually, and is now trying to reconnect his lost ties with Trump's old friends, CHINA. What he wants with them is between his son and them! Um! What else, Oh, oh YEAH! COVID 19! OVER 1 MILLION DEAD AND just a little trouble with the world's economy losing trillions of dollars WHICH Trump tried so hard to fix. NOT THE WORLD, just America by printing a bit of cash untill things get better. So much more to tell including space travel for people who want to go. YES! SPACE! not tooooo far but SPACE indeed! Ummm! tap, tap, tap, just the usual earthquake etc, I just can't think. I've been under house arrest like the rest of Australia, umm! Oh! The Olympics have just started a year late cause of everyone dying and all, what else, o.k. we bought some Tomohawk missiles from America along with some other stuff that blows up cause we are going to war with China! Yes our old friends have 2 warships sitting off top East Australia with really big radar jammers disguised as listening stuff! We are dog food if they decide to get mad! Our Prime minister said bad but true things to them cause that's what our buddies USA did and monkey see monkey do BUT last we saw of the USA monkey it was doing backstroke across the Pacific in the direction of San Fran Sisco! So much for backup against China. We really are living on borrowed time. Nice one PM! What else! So much to tell and no time to say it. We just won a Gold medal at an Olympic Games with no spectators and here comes CHINA. See you later Aligator!",

            "text": "Thank you so much for this optimistic piece about nuclear power. \n    I just wanted to add more about the positive effects. \n   In the worst case scenarios of a massive earthquake and tidal wave with Fukushima no one died of radiation poisoning. But rather from the overreaction of the government not allowing people to return to their homes. \n     A lot of people could have returned to their homes with very few mitigating factors. \n   With Chernobyl, the RBMK reactors primary design was to create plutonium for nuclear weapons. Electricity was just a byproduct.\n     The accident occurred because of the reckless ambitions of the lead engineer on duty. The deaths were created by the Soviet government not being upfront about the disaster.\n   Just hundreds of feet away was reactor number three and then reactor number two and one. They kept running for about another 15 years.\n   In both these scenarios today there is tourism including people that are walking right up to the reactor for a limited amount of time.\n   Everyone knows that the news sells fear and anger. The news is part of the problem with keeping this truly green energy source from being deployed.\n     There are forces that want to make nuclear power so expensive it can never be bilt.  Principle among them are oil companies. \n     The deaths and expense of global warming with its extreme weather is obvious and plays out everyday.\n     I'm excited about generation 4 reactors.  They're about six different designs and they have about six different characteristics. \n    Some of the best characteristics are\n-They're considered walk away safe.\n-They burn more nuclear waste than they create.\n-The waste is considered hazardous for far less time.\n-They're non-proliferation so they can't be used for nuclear weapons. \n- The designs are small and can be as common as a hospital. They take up the footprint of about a Walmart. A truly local power grid to accompany wind and solar.\n    This is truly the future that's going to power our electric cars and  trucks.  Some of the byproducts of nuclear power is creating hydrogen. This could power our airplanes, trains and ships.\n    I look forward to clean skies without smog or inversion layers.\n    I would much rather live next door to a nuclear power plant then a power plant admitting CO2 gas in other poisons and toxins.",

Is it because it doesn't provide an extra amount of nuclear power to provide for the nuclear weapons and wouldn't be worth it anymore?  Can someone please provide an argument explaining the economic drawbacks of this concept of thorium reactors other than the fear in interference of income streams of all energy source suppliers and politics that involve the possibility of becoming a superpower through our economy? No one wants to be #1, always #2 in a political viewpoint. That makes me sad. Our own fear is fueling and preventing us from making groundbreaking contributions to further develop our society. I understand that there's no absolute solution to every problem like this, but at least we should make an effort for something that could possibly change our future more than what anything could in the long term. It's sad knowing there is no real explanation as to why we're not funding these projects.",

            "text": "All the \"I watched an HBO Miniseries that Fictionalized Nuclear Power and was riddled with scientific inaccuracies\" goof balls are running wild. \n\nIf you're a nuclear engineer, operator, or at the very least a physicist, it pains to see these people talk. \n\nIt also is painful to watch videos from wonderful content creators on a complicated subject that don't seem to have that great of a grip on nuclear power, or why it is so good, but I don't hold that against them. It's \"expensive\" because of fear-mongering and legislation. It's not actually *that* expensive when you can mass produce a standard model, like France and South Korea does.\n\nAlso, LWRs, the way you described them, would constitute a lot of non LWRs. LWRs are unique in one major regard: the coolant and moderator are both regular water, and these designs are predominantly Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), some are BWRs (Boiling). It's also important to note that these designs are largely based on an inspired by naval reactor designs, as that is where reactor plants first started emerging, which is why modern reactor designs are trying to get away from that, because, obviously, we can accomplish more on land than in a submarine with more efficient designs. There are no size or area restrictions. The LWR/PWR design is really great for small reactor plants, but not the most optimal for large, commercial reactors, which is what 80ish% of the world's reactors are like.. they're Gen2 Reactor Plants. I will grant that the LWR is not the \"safest or most elegant\" reactor design, but I think putting it in that context is a but misleading. LWRs are VERY safe, and still statistically safer than any other power production platform, outside of other reactor plant designs. Technically, a lot of our Gen4 designs that will be in construction by the end of this coming decade are safer, more efficient, and considerably more complex than LWRs, or any other current operational reactor that we have.. but they're all still very safe, and their capacity factor, at least in the US, is very high. About 90%. \n\nI also think it is unfair to say that Three Mile Island \"barely escaped\" its catastrophe. The containment vessel, which is made of reinforced steel and several feet of concrete, did its job, and it wasn't even close to succumbing. This is a prominent difference between Chernobyl and TMI, or the Soviet Era reactors and the US. The RBMK-1000 would have never been licensed in the US, for a number of reasons, including the positive reactivity coefficient and the lack of a containment vessel. Some reinforced steel and concrete would have nullified everything that die. Also, regulations are much more strict in the US, and so is the safety atmosphere in general. \n\nThe \"radioactive cloud that threatened central Europe\" is extremely hyperbolic. Europe was just fine. People fictionalize the extent of radiation or how much it increased the surrounding areas. \n\nHere's my question. Everyone, and I mean everyone, seems to know about Chernobyl or Fukushima. Movies, series, and YouTube videos will be dedicated to them regularly, including videos like this. Yet, how's come we never hear about the worst energy disaster? The Banqaio Dam Collapse in 1975 China killed 200,000+ people and displaced 11 million from their homes, and I sincerely doubt anyone really even knows about this, let alone will we see the media talking about it. Nothing comes close to this disaster, and its environmental impact and death toll is worse than every nuclear reactor plant in history, combined. Yet, hydroelectric power is still one of the safest forms of energy, just being nuclear. *It's an example of how unfairly it is treated, fictionalized, and sensationalized.*\n\n\"",

The nuclear industry does not deserve a black eye. \n\n1st: Three mile island was part of the new atomic age (1979) so everyone didn\u2019t 100% understand how it worked or what could go wrong. It\u2019s 2019 so we have better technology to understand the nuclear industry so now something \nas small as a stuck P.O.V valve can  be detected. \n\n2nd: Chernobyl was caused by complete ignorance and by the lack of guidelines. The operators pushed the reactor past its limits and they also cut off the reactors shutdown systems. If the NRC stepped in and set certain guidelines for everyone that would\u2019ve of happened so I\u2019ll give the nuclear haters that one.\n\n3rd:  Fukushima was unpreventable. The nuclear plant like everyone else had no awareness of a incoming earthquake. After the earth quake hit they followed procedures like normal by shutting down the plant. Keep in mind they were doing this with back up generators. They were most of the way shut down when the tsunami hit. The tsunami flooded the diesel generators and then all power was lost.  At that point their was nothing that anyone could really do. All this was due to Mother Nature.",

            "text": "I like to show a video such as this and then provide a transcript to go along with questions to assist students. It is a simple and effective accommodation.\u00a0 Here is a corrected and usable transcript:\n\n\n\nNUCLEAR ENERGY & HOW IT WORKS (PART 1/3)\n\n\nHave you ever been in an argument about nuclear power? \u00a0We have, and we found it frustrating and\nconfusing, so let's try and get to grips with this topic. \u00a0\n\n\nIt all started in the 1940s. After the shock and horror of\nthe war and the use of the atomic bomb, nuclear energy promised to be a\npeaceful spin-off of the new technology, helping the world get back on its feet.\nEveryone's imagination was running wild. \u00a0Would electricity become free? Could nuclear\npower helped settle the Antarctic? Would there be nuclear powered cars, planes,\nor houses? It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away. One\nthing was certain: the future was atomic.\n\n\nJust a few years later there was a sort of Atomic Age hangover;\nas it turned out, nuclear power was very complicated and very expensive. Turning\nphysics into engineering was easy on paper but hard in real life. Also, private\ncompanies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment; most\nof them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil. But there were many\npeople who didn't just want to abandon the promise of the Atomic Age; an exciting\nnew technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity, the prospect of\nbeing independent of oil and gas imports, and, in some cases, a secret desire\nto possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going. \n\n\nNuclear power\u2019s finest hour finally came in the early 1970s,\nwhen war in the Middle East caused oil prices to skyrocket worldwide. Now,\ncommercial interest and investment picked up at a dazzling pace. More than half\nof all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985. But\nwhich type of reactor to build, given how many different types there were to\nchoose from? A surprising underdog candidate won the day: the light water\nreactor. It wasn't very innovative and it wasn't too popular of scientists, but\nit had some decisive advantages: it was there, it worked, and it wasn't terribly\nexpensive. \n\n\nSo, what does a light water reactor do? Well the basic principle\nis shockingly simple: it heats up water using an artificial chain reaction. Nuclear\nfission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could.\nReally heavy elements on the brink of stability, like uranium-235, get\nbombarded with neutrons. The neutron is absorbed, but the result is unstable. Most\nof the time, it immediately spits into fast-moving lighter elements, some\nadditional free neutrons, and energy in the form of radiation. The radiation heats\nthe surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms, releasing\nmore neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction. Very different\nfrom the first destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb. \n\n\nIn our light water reactor, a moderator is needed to control\nthe neutrons energy. Simple, ordinary water does the job, which is very\npractical, since waters used to drive the turbines anyway. The light water\nreactor became prevalent because it's simple and cheap. However, it's neither\nthe safest, most efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.\n\n\nThe renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade though. In\n1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a catastrophe\nwhen its core melted. In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened\nCentral Europe with a radioactive cloud, and in 2011 the drawn-out Fukushima\ndisaster sparked new discussions and concerns. \n\n\nWhile, in the 1980s, 218 new nuclear power reactors went\nlive, their number and nuclear\u2019s global share of electricity production has\nstagnated since the end of the 80s. So, what's the situation today? Today, nuclear\nenergy meets around 10% of the world's energy demand. There are about 439\nnuclear reactors in 31 countries. About 70 new reactors are under construction in\n2015, most of them in countries which are growing quickly. All in all, 160 new reactors\nare planned worldwide. Most nuclear reactors were built more than 25 years ago\nwith pretty old technology. More than 80% are various types of light water\nreactor. Today, many countries are faced with a choice: the expensive\nreplacement of the aging reactors, possibly with more efficient, but less\ntested models, or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older\ntechnology with different cost and environmental impacts. So, should we use\nnuclear energy?",

Volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide, so if there's a volcano nearby the power station, the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide will interact each other and will cause acid cloud to form.

We can only get windmill electricity when it\u2019s windy. When it\u2019s not windy, electricity isn\u2019t produced.\ne.) Some people might get distracted.\n\nd.) Water Energy\nPros:\na.) They don\u2019t cause any money\nb.) Water is a renewable resource because water goes in cycle\nc.) Water doesn\u2019t emit pollution\nd.) Some water in the water combustion can turn saltwater or polluted water into fresh water.\ne.) They can control flooding, deep water ways for shipping.\nf.) Some dams have fish ladders.\ng.) Tidal barrages and hydroelectric power stations are very reliable and can be easily switched on.\nCons:\na.) It takes quite a long time to build a water combustion dam\nb.) If there were an accident, it could cause flood and ruin the habitat nearby\nc.) If we set a nuclear atomic bomb, it might cause tsunami to surge\nd.) It can\u2019t be made anywhere in the land and it only can be made near the water area\ne.) It has been difficult to scale up the designs for wave machines to produce large amounts of electricity\nf.) Dams interrupt the life cycle of the organism nearby.\ng.) Sometimes reservoir water is cold and destroy organism nearby.\nh.) Dams flood farmland and push people from their homes.\n\ne.) Geothermal Energy\nPros:\na.) Geothermal energy don\u2019t cost any money\nb.) They are tough, not delicate\nc.) They are renewable resource because they go in never ending cycle like the water cycle\nd.) They don\u2019t emit pollution\ne.) It takes a short time; each cycle lasts for a minute or even way shorter.\nf.) They are very efficient.\ng.) They take a short time to build.\nCons: No Cons\n\nf.) Solar Energy\nPros:\na.) Solar Energy is a renewable energy because the sun is always there\nb.) They don\u2019t emit pollution\nc.) They are shiny like metal\nd.) Solar cells can provide electricity in remote locations where there is no mains electricity\ne.) Some solar energy is efficient\nf.) Some solar energy is cheap\nCons:\na.) Some solar energy is inefficient\nb.) Some solar energy is expensive\nc.) On sunlight or twilight can turn into electricity. When it\u2019s cloudy or raining, there will be twilight. When there\u2019s dark thunderstorm or it\u2019s night, solar panel is at rest and won\u2019t work.\nd.) Some people might get distracted.\n\ng.) Electrical Energy\nPros:\nFor Lightning:\na.) Lightning contains millions of voltages, so each struck can store lot of electricity\nb.) Lightning is a renewable resource because thunderstorms are part of water cycle\nc.) Lightning doesn't emit pollution\nd.) Lightning doesn't cost any money\ne.) We don\u2019t have work for lightning because it\u2019s done naturally\nf.) Lightning is very efficient\ng.) If lightning struck slightly off the power station, it\u2019ll still work\nh.) Lightning goes in zig zag, so if the lightning start striking above where it\u2019s not the power station, it can curve and find its way to the power station\ni.) Lightning is bright and very hot enough to strengthen the electricity\nFor Electric Eel:\na.) Electric eels contains thousands of voltages, so each electric eel can store a lot of electricity\nb.) Electric eel is a renewable resource because it\u2019s an animal, it can multiply.\nc.) Electric eel can be done anytime even though it\u2019s not stormy\nd.) Electric eel don\u2019t emit pollution\ne.) Electric eel don\u2019t cost any money.\nf.) Electric eel can be placed accurately.\ng.) They can build houses nearby the electric power station\nh.) People and animals who is nearby won\u2019t be distracted and won\u2019t damage their ears.\nCons:\nFor Lightning:\na.) Lightning can\u2019t be done anytime and it only can be done when it\u2019s stormy\nb.) We can\u2019t predict where the lightning will exactly strike, so it may not strike the power station\nc.) Lightning is very hot and it is about 30,000\u2103\nd.) Lightning is very loud, therefore they need to be away.\ne.) People or animal nearby would be distracted and this noise could damage their ears.\nf.) They can\u2019t build houses nearby the electric power station\ng.) This noise can be frightening to them\nh.) Lightning goes in zig zag path, so if the lightning starts striking above the power station, it may turn its path and may not strike the power station\ni.) Only cloud to ground lightning works. Sheet lightning and cloud to cloud lightning doesn't work\nj.) Some thunderstorms don\u2019t have cloud to ground lightning\nk.) The power station must be metal aluminum, otherwise it won\u2019t work\nFor Electric Eel:\na.) Electric eels are difficult to get because they live in the sea\nb.)Electric eels may use electricity for defense, so they need to wear protective clothes and handle electric eels very carefully\nc.)Not only using electricity, electric eels can kick someone, so they need to use an oil rig to get the electric eel and trap it in the net very tightly.",

For example, the Integral Molten Salt Reactor or IMSR (made in Canada) is a completely different kind of reactor which:\n1. Cannot melt down, as the fuel/salt mix is already in a molten state\n2. Creates extremely small amounts of waste, which are only radioactive for a couple hundred years (instead of 20,000!)\n3. Can use spent Uranium as a fuel - or Thorium, which is as plentiful as lead, and safe enough to hold in your hand\n4. Does not create usable bomb-making material (Plutonium) - so no proliferation problems\n5. Is much smaller and less expensive than the huge outdated reactors in use all over the place\n6. Is completely walk-away safe - so worst case scenario is that the plant shuts down and cools off by itself\n... and many many more benefits",

            "text": "In a free market world real change comes through realpolitik and economics. We can't expect change to occur if the FINANCIAL incentives remain the same.\nThe real battle is between nuclear and fossil fuels. So why is fossil fuel usage more abundant than nuclear fuel for electricity production  - even though the latter is cheaper and cleaner? My theory: \nFossil fuels are consumed in far larger quantities, so a company handling for example oil will be far more PROFITABLE than one selling uranium or constructing nuclear power stations (exacerbated by the risk associated with them). That's why there are is no ExxonNuclear or Royal Dutch Uranium. And with money comes influence, that influence is then used to promote the usage of oil in electricity production. The foundation is then laid for increased profits, increased political leverage, increased profit, etc. As significantly less uranium is consumed for nuclear power, most of it is a one-time cost --- in other words not as profitable as the steady sales of oil.\nThe situation is that we have one block benefitting tremendously from increased fossil fuel consumtion (the producers and the car industry) --- versus the entire rest of society (the energy consumers, most notably the public) --- and the former wins simply because in practice, they work toward a very clear goal (increasing consumtion of their product) whereas the latter are fragmented in all the other sectors that consume energy, and doesn't produce it.\n1) Oil companies have a disproportionately large amount of influence and revenue, simply because of tradition and the fundamental dynamics of how oil is consumed combined with the market.\n2) In order for nuclear power to become viable, the consumer has to become the producer. ALL OTHER industry sectors would benefit hugely from decreased energy prices -- they just need to invest and lobby for it, and provide an ACTUAL counterforce against the now unopposed fossil fuel industry.\nOil producers are way overdue, technology already exist to compete with them, it's just a matter of market dynamics.",

But those are only a small part of the world.\n\nBut the mistake probably came from mixing up electricity with energy. The world uses many more types of energy than just elecricty. For example: fuel in cars, energy for heating or energy for processes in industries.\n\nIf you take electricity alone, the average of nuclear is about 11%.

Coal plants not only release CO2, but actually release about the same amount radioactive contamination in to environment than nuclear. This is because coal when burned isn't really processed, and when it gets burnt whatever trace element in also get burnt. Further since the NRC doesn't regulate coal plants, the actually dose at coal plant is about 100 times higher than that at a nuclear power plant. This also doesn't included the heavy metal contamination due to the ash. Nuclear has it's problems, but strictly better for the environment than Coal.",

This waste has to be cooled and guarded. Nice heritage for our children.\n\nSecond problem is that we will run out of uranium pretty soon too.\n\nAnd then there is risk of human mistakes which could have massive consequences.\n\nNuclear energy is a very good option for the future though, but not in way promoted in this video.\nWhat I am hinting at is nuclear fusion.\n\nIn my opinion the world needs loads of people doing research in nuclear fusion, but also in energy storage!

The video says that the radiation then deposits its energy in the water - this is highly misleading because only about 3% of the reactor's heat is deposited in the water/moderator.\n\nThe vast majority of the energy of the reaction is carried in the fission products themselves (the atoms the Uranium splits into). Because these are extremely heavy and charged, they don't make it more than a millimeter before being stopped. As such, they are fully contained within the fuel element. They do a great deal of damage to the fuel material, but that's why we have the rods to contain any gases that leak out of the ceramic fuel.\n\nSo you really shouldn't say that the radiation's heat gets deposited in the water. It mostly gets deposited in the fuel. Neutrinos actually carry away some energy, and they continue into space forever. This is still a fairly small fraction of total energy.",

It's clean and delivers a before unseen amount of power for the size of the package and the longevity of it's fuel. I believe that the concerns on safety would evaporate with the advancement and refinement of tecnology.\nWhat made me jump over the fence from time to time. Was a video I watched about how building a nuclear powerplant requires an huge amount of energy to mine fore uranium ore and refine it. All the costs involved translate into CO2 because of transportation and the blackstart coal-based powerplants.\nIt seems that nuclear energy is quite far from clean although the powerplant itself is clean indeed.",

If we refined and developed it more, I'm sure it would easily meet the world's electricity needs more efficiently and therefore cheaply than any other method we currently use. As far as the environmental impact goes, the only issue is getting rid of the depleted uranium (or whatever other element is used). I reckon that with the money we save by ditching oil, coal and gas, we'd be able to send it all to space/into the sun anyway.",

The mines are usually in remote to untouched areas, inhabited by, for example, Canada's Native peoples, Australia's Aboriginal or indigenous peoples of Africa. Mining leads to interference with their culture and religion, and gives risks of chemical and radioactive pollution of soil and water. On the other hand, the mines provides jobs and higher living standards for people. So obviously there are conflicts of interests.\n\nMy personal vision is a future without nuclear power, where we invest in renewable energy such as hydro, wind, solar and bioenergy. Nuclear plants are dependent on uranium and uranium is not a renewable energy source. Instead of building new nuclear power plants that cost millions and which then requires large amounts of money in maintenance in connection with the disposal of spent fuel. The money should instead be spent to expand the research into renewable energy.\nThough the phase out of nuclear power should always be made so it doesn't increase the energy supply of fossil fuels.\n\nAlso the risks of having a nuclear power plant can never be zero. A nuclear accident would cost billions of dollars.\u00a0\n\nThat's why each one should take into consideration their energy consumption, for a better future and environment for us all! :)",

On one hand, it's a cheap source of energy we can use to replace the older technology that is responsible for a good portion of the carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere every year. In fact, had we invested in safer types of reactors in the 70's, it's very likely we could have significantly minimized the effects of climate change. But at what cost?\n\nThe best way we can think of to store nuclear material is to seal it up and put it underground in an area where nobody will ever live. Then you have natural disasters that can cause nuclear plants to fail, compounding the damage of the disaster with the threat of radioactive exposure. Finally, newer technologies are starting to advance rapidly, so in the decades it would take to build enough of these plants to become free of older, polluting plants, we will likely have better and safer means to produce electricity.",
