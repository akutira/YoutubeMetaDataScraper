                "text": "👉👉👉🤞🤞🤞🤞👇👇👇👇This is a message from the patriots of the empire to the European Union, the United Kingdom, the American government, the American Democratic Party, and the CIA spy organization, which behind the scenes has supported the government of the Islamic Republic and military and religious mercenary governments in Persia and Iran for a hundred years. take away the oil and mineral resources of this country. It will spread that according to Plato, it is the third type of government, which is called aristocracy or the government of elites, scientists, artists, philosophers and geniuses, not democracy. The difference of the western world does not accept or accept this movement or global thought. is The desire of the western world, which is subject to freemasonry and globalization thinking, will happen in Iran in the near future. In this type of government or political system, there is no such thing as war, poverty, religion, mentally, physically and mentally ill people, and political boundaries. The Western world does not understand the issue because Cain's capitalist thought has been placed in the genes of the human race, and this devil has ruled the earth, and the devil has deceived the human mind through governments, digital media, and money. So the people of the earth all live in hell and the light of the truth of the human soul is either dead or the human will do it after death and bring it to immortality and immortality. This issue has been the history of creation since the birth of Cain, the first freemason. The generation of perfect extraterrestrial God-like humans was supposed to be implemented by an extraterrestrial civilization on earth with the settling of Adam and Eve, which was not realized by the devil with the birth of Cain from Adam's illegitimate second wife named Lilith. Every country or every country's spy organizations with this new thinking. Or the Persian Empire disagrees with the fundamental human rights laws of Achaemenid Cyrus, in principle, he disagreed with the opinion of God, who was the creator of the generation of intelligent humans. West and European Europe and England and the spy organization like. The CIA and MI6 are reminded that they will stop supporting the mercenary and religious governments in Iran and the gangs and traitors like the Nayak and Farshgerd groups in the US and Europe, which in the future will carry out economic activities in the US and Iran. So the wise solution is for the western world to change its politics and thinking in Iran, so that with peace in politics and Iran, the economic, political and cultural benefits of this peace or Persian empire will be transferred to the western world. . The fundamental goal of this world peace is human peace between the people of the earth, not their bank accounts. All these things are said only to fulfill the cosmic and human mission through the global internet network to all the people of the earth and all the governments without considering the economic interests and bank accounts. It is them. The reason for the war is the existence of defective genes of Cain in the genes of all the people of the earth. which must be corrected with a special device and genetic engineering science. The main reason for the war between the human race is the difference of thought and genetic difference, not the common human spirit. The devil's trick was to infect the basic genes of Adam and Eve's generation with Cain's gene, because the devil has a soul. is It was not. The foundation of the Pars Empire in the future is based on the human spirit and as a result of securing the economic and people's interests of Iran and other nations. It is backward. This important message is a nudge or a warning or a shock to the western world to change its way of thinking towards the eastern world and the people of Iran.☝☝☝👈👈👈👈🌹🌹🌹🌹🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",

                "text": "Now, I am an American, and, as an American, I was raised in a country that is a Federation of 50 United States, each State having its own identity, its own State Government, with it's own laws and it's own Executive Governor, Legislative Senate and Judicial Court, each State even has it's own State Military known as the State Gaurd, each with a Army Branch known as the National Guard, a Navel Branch known as the Coast Gaurd and an Air Force Branch known as the Air Gaurd. But all 50 states are United under a single US Federation, the US Federal Government centered in Washington DC. So I understand if you believe my American way of thinking gives me a bias for Federation between sovereign States, leading me to have that much more optimism for \"The United Kingdoms of Europe\" Or the UK of E. That said, the EU is most definitely worthwhile, and well, each of the United Nations of Europe do have their own identity, rich with history, customs, and traditions. They each have their own government with their own laws and government structure, I can most definitely assure all concerned that Federal Unity is possible and quite necessary for the Europeans, first the European Federation, the European Union is responsible for ensuring interconnection between the different European countries, which is a security wall preventing any future European war, and war is truly horrible. It was horrible in the days of melee weapons and it is all the worse today in the modern age of WMDs, as Sir Lancelot put it in that short story, \"We have World Wars now, we number them to tell them apart. We fought our wars with swords, and with lance, now there are weapons that can fire a city in the blink of an eye, and poison the Earth for longer than you. Merlin has slept.\" The point being that we must prevent war any way possible, and the EU is a key to accomplishing that goal. Farther more the EU streamlines travel and collaboration between people of different European countries, leading to ever greater innovation, which leads to improvements in quality of life for all, from the Scientific, Technological and Industrial advances that come from that collaboration. The Unity of the EU also gives the European countries more leverage to push back at organizations that infringe on the rights of European citizens, one British parlorment member brought this up by discussing food safety laws in the US, stating how he couldn't believe hearing that US law allows for acceptable levels of contamination in our food supply, believing at first that Americans would never tolerate such contamination in our food supply, until he read it for himself from an American law book, the parlorment member stating on the British parlorment floor \"If the food companies can push America around like that, what chance can we ever have if we leave the EU?\" This makes the EU just as much a safe guard for European rights as it is a safe guard against European wars. So yes, the EU is more than worth it. Now that said, to address the challenges. American history has demonstrated time and again how Unity between states requires federal cohesion, that the federal government must set some basic ground rules which all member states need to adhere to. The US civil war, being just one particularly famous case in point. So just as the US federal government had to do and must continue to do it, the EU needs to set and enforce some constitutional ground rules for UE member states to adhere to. This will likely mean the EU will have to take swift and forceful action against any member states that refuse to comply with these ground rules, and that will likely prove unpopular especially among the citizens of the offending member state, but if push does come to shove, it will have to be done. We Americans sadly had to fight a war to abolish slavery in our own country, because the southern states refused to comply with Presidential orders and US Constitutional mandate to discontinue slavery, and chose instead to rebel against the Constitution's infringement on their \"right to own slaves.\" Leading to the US civil war. Hopefully, the European citizens of any such rebelling European countries will be able to learn from that tragedy of US history and sufficiently wise up and promptly comply with the EU federal mandates before it comes to that. That all said some ground rules the EU will have to establish and enforce as needed include but may not be limited to the following \n1: European money \nWell the EU established the Euro as a continental currency for all European Union member countries to except as a common currency, the EU will likely have to mandate that all EU members adopt the Euro as their sole currency, so as to more strongly unite all member economies under this single monetary system. This will likely mean more than simply prohibiting national currencies as each member states will also have to adhere to the EU set standards of the Euro's rate of exchange and overall value of economic power. This will likely include the EU needing to set a single federal European minimum wage standard and will likely need to set EU federal taxes for any EU federal services. \n2: Standards for transparency \nAs you said in your video the EU needs to be more transparent in what they do for the common European and how they do it, this will likely require EU information services, such as publication of EU government records for news media and the general European public to access, this will likely require an EU established information infrastructure including European federal public libraries which will require EU federal standards for general operations including architectural standards for accessibility and accommodation for Europeans with applicable ability differences. This standardization of information infrastructure will likely have to include an EU federal standard language for all European Union members so as to ensure sufficient bridging of language barriers between citizens of different member nations, with the EU likely going to need to mandate this single EU language as the sole language for all EU member nations ultimately abolishing all national languages in favor of the single EU Federal language. \n3: Utility infrastructure \nAs the EU builds ever more collaboration and interconnection between the different member nations, any incapatabilities between different nations' infrastructure will become more and more of an issue. So, the EU is going to need to set EU federal standards for connections, utilities standards, system standards, and anything else that would affect the capatability of work interconnection. \n4: European immigration \nAs a sovereign nation, the EU is a jurisdiction with defined sovereign dominion, which includes defined borders and citizenship. As such, the EU is going to have to establish and enforce those standards that are going to include standards for non European peoples entering the European Union sovereign domain and becoming citizens of the European Union. Including a European Union Federal standard for immigration entry and citizenship naturalization process. Including standards for the rights of the immigrants entering the EU member nations and how the member nations may treat the immigrants entering the EU's common federal domain. With the EU likely going to have to set a common standard of distribution of responsibilities among the member nations to ensure each member Nation carries their fair share of the challenges related to the entry and integration/assimilation of these new citizens.",

From what I've seen, there is a big issue with the difference between countries. Mainly, I don't agree with the European Union. It's just a pretty facade to take advantage of smaller economies and exploit them. The rule of law doesn't exist and will never exist in the European Union. There is an extreme exclusion towards countries with smaller economies. Small countries will never reach equality with the big ones, there is no equality between people. And there never will be. I don't agree with having more people telling me what to do, how to live, what to eat, how much heat I can have in my house, how to raise my animals, and tripling the prices of my products for decisions that I don't even understand. In my opinion, the European Union is just a thought, an illusion for the foolish. I don't see why I should suffer for other countries when they don't help us in any way. The difference between the rich and the poor is extremely large. There shouldn't be such a thing. The rules of the European Union have never been respected. There is no equality between the member states, and there never will be. Mainly, I don't need rulers that stay in the European Union. My country was much better off before joining the European Union.",

And the Democratic Party of America has even provided financial aid to the terrorist militant group of the Taliban, ISIS, and Al-Qaeda. So every American citizen knows or does not know that by voting for Kamla Harris, his hand is in the blood of the people of Iran and It has infected Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. So it is logical that Mr. Donald Trump will be elected in the next American elections to destroy the Islamic Republic of Iran. Even the Taliban have established peace in the Middle East and Iran, and its economic, political and cultural benefits will reach the United States, the European Union, and the people of Iran and the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East is peace in all lands and other countries. And the consequences of every good or bad event in one region of the world will later be transferred to other parts of the world and countries because we live in the age of globalization. If the virus called the Islamic Republic of Iran is not stopped, the destructive effects of this virus in the form of the spread of terrorism and even Drug trafficking will spread to European countries and America. And the main culprit of this incident is the Democratic Party of America with the symbol of the donkey or the anti-Christ and the European Union, which behind the scenes have provided political and economic support to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This dirty policy is the same. There is an old Iranian proverb that says be friends with the headman or lord of a village so that later you can take over that village or city for free. The policy of the Democratic Party of America and the European Union is to be friends with the corrupt leaders of religious and military dictatorships in the Middle East so that Later, they can indirectly plunder the mineral resources of these countries behind the scenes and at the same time condemn the crimes of these corrupt governments in the United Nations. The people of Iran and the Middle East have understood this. This message is sent to the people of America and Europe that they must decide which of the candidates of the American Democratic and Republican parties to vote for. In the near future, with the establishment of a democratic government in Iran, the main leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be arrested and prosecuted. has been the cradle of human civilization in the past as a democratic state. Accepting this issue as the formation of a Middle East union like the European Union with Iran as the center will create the golden economic silk road from east to west and will cause economic, political and cultural balance between the two The country of Iran is like a falcon in the middle of two balances.

All at 25 years old and out of nowhere, like he is one of the most fit healthy person I know really and our family had no history of any type of cancer.\n\n Gladly he overcame all of it and is know doing awesome, but he fought for a whole year against it. And one of the keys for his treatment was getting early check ups as soon as he felt something was wrong, so both cancers were caught at really early stages. So yea, if yall feel like something feels bad on x part of your body go make an early check, it can truly be life saving",

Few people die because they forgot to put a seatbelt on, but you'd be horrified to know how many taxi drivers I've met who choose not to put their seatbelts on because they believe having one on is _more_ dangerous. Some are even offended when I put mine on.\nThese people will not listen to this message, and I'm positive they will make up the vast majority of next week's fatalities.",

                "text": "Hey Everybody! So this video has a mistake and we remade it!  You can watch the corrected and updated Version here: https://youtu.be/uzkD5SeuwzM\n\nWhat is the mistake? In a nutshell: It is not PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the Local Group as we said in this version. It is just extremely unlikely that we’ll ever do it, even for the standards of our videos.\nBUT: If you have a lot of time and a fast spaceship you can still fly to a limited amount of galaxies – these galaxies will eventually get out of reach forever but until then, they are within reach. Although every second some of them escape us forever.\n\nOk, if this is so why did we keep the video up and not purge it when we deleted our addiction and refugee crisis videos? Well, it has to do with the nature and severity of the mistake: This mistake was much more straight forward then with the other two videos, so we did talk to a few astrophysicists to ask them what they thought and if we should take down the video. Their feedback was pretty clear, they thought it was still fine as the universe expansion things explained in the video are correct and they didn’t consider the local group thing as too major. This was actually a case of “good enough”.\n\nAlso, back when this original upload happened, Kurzgesagt was operating at pretty tight margins and just redoing a video was not easy for us. Back then the team was small and we were fighting to put new videos out. So we just swallowed the bitter pill and kept the video around.\n\nBut the video still bothered us, as far as we know this was the biggest unfixed mistake on the channel. Super frustrating, especially because the core idea of the video is so fascinating. The limit of our species. The actual limit. So yeah, we finally remade the video, sorry for taking this long, life got in the way.\n\nThe original video will stay up, you can compare the two if you want to see how far we have come in a few years in terms of production quality. All in all, we could only grow the channel and work on getting better because of direct support from you guys. So thank you for that. – Philipp\n\nPS: If you want, check out our shop for some new posters about the universe posters and black hole plushies and stuff like that: kgs.link/shop​",

                "text": "I still think the most obvious explanation is distance and rarity. I dont think life is so rare that we are alone, the evidence we have seen for our development doesnt point to that being the case as of yet. But I do think it is considerably rare. And even among planets with life on it, life intelligent enough to become advanced is rare. Look how many species exist now and have existed in the past on earth, and only 1 of them, Humans, were able to become the advanced civilization we are now (relative to the animal kingdom, at least). There could only be one planet in every similarly sized galaxy, or hell one per 10 galaxies, or even a hundred, that actually has life on it, and of those, perhaps only 1 in a thousand has intelligent enough life to become advanced. And then of those, its even less that have actually reached type 3, we havent even hit type 1 yet. So I imagine that these type 3 civilizations probably exist but are extremely far away from us, perhaps so far that the light carrying the evidence of their existence (and ours vice versa) hasnt reached us yet. And even if it had, would it even be possible for them to tell we are here? Would it even be possible for us to tell theyre there? We cant even figure out if there is and isnt other life within our solar system yet, if I remember correctly theres a space mission to search for life on one of mars moons happening in the near future. Let alone neighboring solar systems let alone our galaxy or the whole universe.\n\nAdvanced life IS out there, we are just too far apart to know about eachother. I think there have been and will always be filters in our past and future, thats the nature of survival, challenges always present themselves. But even in those instances of apocalypse, AI wouldnt have a logical reason to annihilate all life on earth like they would to eliminate humans, and full on nuclear war also wouldnt completely eliminate life, nor will climate change, even if all of those scenarios eliminate humans. Which means intelligent life would have a chance to reemerge after the recovery of the planet. (Plus, in an AI takeover, wouldnt those AI then go on to make their own civilization? The same paradoxical lack of evidence applies to that as well...)",

I had chicken pox, bronchitis and everything else except polio (thankfully I was vaccinated - or rather given it on a sugar cube!), mumps and smallpox. I cannot be vaccinated against smallpox (at least I couldn't when I was young, heaven only knows if the warnings have changed) because I had severe eczema as a baby. (It's not as severe now, thankfully!) It apparently could have had nasty side-effects including blindness. Fortunately, the _vast_ majority of people had the vaccine, so I never needed it. I can't tell them how grateful I am that they did that.\n\nYou can be damned sure that my four kids got every available vaccine, mostly to protect them, but also to protect those who couldn't. Don't be an anti-vax idiot. If you don't like the MMR schedule, your GP can work with you on it. But if your kid gets measles especially, you could be signing their death warrant, or that of a vulnerable neighbour or relative. If they survive, they may well go deaf and/or blind. I'm sure they wouldn't thank you for that.",

Now she gets a sinus infection 4+ times a year and has a chronic dry cough that never goes away. \n\nIt has become so bad that she literally screamed at me for expressing my concern. Did the whole “I’ve been alive for (insert age here) so I know what I’m doing”. She doesn’t get it that she feels better after taking them because the viral infection is going away on its own regardless of the antibiotic. \n\nLove that my family has gotten to the point where even expressing concern / saying I wish they wouldn’t take them without a proper bacterial test immediately gets me screamed at about “I won’t take them but it’s on you if this infection goes to my brain and kills me”.

Also of the 4,300 solar system studies, not one looks like our solar system, able to support life. The Milky Way Galaxy is the only stable barred spiral galaxy. In other galaxies, there is no place for a rocky planet without deadly radiation or orbit interference. Earth’s vast and stable magnetic field is unique, most planets the magnetic field is short-lived or unstable. Earth’s magnetic field protects life from deadly radiation. The list can go on and on (rotation rate, astrosphere, right carbon dioxide, low carbon monoxide, one large moon, very low eccentricity). There are 5,759 confirmed exoplanets, not one looks like Earth or any of the planets in our solar system. Also needed for complex life are Solar System's belts. Only our system as solar system's belts. Most systems have not belts and a few have only one large belt. The belts give us near circular orbit. We have looked and we are alone.",

One of the most fundamental rights of any farmers is to store some of the seeds from their previous harvest to plant them next year. They can do that, of course, for free. In the case of GMO's, however, the owners of the GMO's (the companies that produce and sometimes patent them), do not allow the farmers to keep those seeds for free - the farmers are obliged to pay for them each and every year. In some cases very brutal lawsuits happened even just because some farmers didn't realize they have, e.g. 30% of GMO's in their seeds, which got there from some other source in the first place. So the farmers are suddenly caught in an never ending loop of having to pay for their seeds, for which they previously did not need to pay. Not to mention the attempts of certain companies (e.g. Monsanto) who tried to patent whole organisms and tried to demand exorbitant prices for them. And this my friends is the real problem of the GMO's, not their toxicity. I am somehow surprised that Kurzgesagt failed to mention this.",

            "description": "Being a human in the 21st century often feels frustrating. We are clearly at the high point of our species, while at the same time life is incredibly hard! We are divided, unable to solve our problems while creating new ones, destroying our world in the process. In many ways the vibe is that we live in dark times. But as Terry Pratchett said, we are the storytelling ape, we think in narratives and live in a network of stories that make up our world. So without minimizing the darkness, we want to add a story that we find helpful for dealing with the world. \n\nSources & further reading:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/sources-visionforhumanity/\n\nThe 12,025 Human Era Calendar is here!

I believe most populations actually worked in equilibrium until codexing of laws. You can see this in the UK, and what changed with the Roman occupation. This caused the population to bloom when previously we kept population in check with our environment.  But thanks for expounding a few myths. We are creating equilibrium again. It's time to stop the fear and debunk these folk that seem to want to reduce the population to none",
